          <p>We as a culture have become extremely dependent on wireless technology to connect users and all kinds of devices.  I can help design, install, configure, and manage your wireless network. I have configured Wi-Fi covering schools, businesses, and event venues.

          <h3 style="text-align: left;">Backup & Recovery&nbsp;</h3>
          <p>I recognize that managing IT, especially when it comes to protecting your software applications’ data, requires a risk-based approach – identifying risks of system downtime, equipment failure, data destruction, and developing appropriate strategies for managing these risks. It is important that you understand and can articulate the relative value of your specific data and applications, and that I can build and maintain systems that align well with your value perception. A number of activities and services provided include keeping backup software versions up to date, monitoring alerts from backup systems, installing firmware to data storage systems, ensuring that all identified critical devices are backed up, managing backup system file organization and providing an appropriate level of training to end users on roles and responsibilities relative to the management and backup systems. Services include planning and execution activities such as data risk profiling; systems inventory documentation; monitoring, alerting and remediating backup system issues; producing detailed recovery planning and actionable testing documentation. A number of services in this category can be prescheduled on a periodic basis as proactive preventative maintenance.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3 style="text-align: left;">Server & Workstation Support&nbsp;</h3>
          <p>This set of services focuses on keeping end users productive with their software and various end user devices. Much of the service provided in this area are provided to remedy unplanned inconveniences, on an as-needed or requested basis; and may include such things as end user training, software glitches, printers or scanners not functioning properly, workstations freezing up, failed hardware, etc. Other tasks, again more on an as-needed basis, may include setting up new devices or software. User training and documentation can lead to a long term trend in reducing a number of these issues. We can work with your team to provide ongoing training and documentation, especially where the organization as a whole can benefit from these things. Typical devices supported include desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, printers, scanners, and any other end user devices. The majority of services provided here tend to be scheduled as you contact us. We always advise that a single point of contact inside your organization works as a gatekeeper to coordinate support requests to ensure that these requests are consistent with your priorities and budget.&nbsp;</p>

I can help add new instances for new versions of Archicad, update old versions, and migrate projects between instances. The projects in BIM Server can be worth thousands of hours of time.
