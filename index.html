                        This includes specific services targeting areas that a typical Chief Information Officer may provide or oversee; including, but not limited to, planning activities such as general technology advisory services, assessment, audit, procurement, budget development, compliance planning, and overall risk management. We provide a number of these services using our best practices for a strategic approach to providing IT services.

                     <p>
                        We recognize that managing IT, especially when it comes to protecting your software applications’ data, requires a risk-based approach – identifying risks of system downtime, equipment failure, data destruction, etc. and developing appropriate strategies for managing these risks. It is important that you understand and can articulate the relative value of your specific data and applications, and that MaC can build and maintain systems that align well with your value perception. A number of activities and services provided include keeping backup software versions up to date, monitoring alerts from backup systems, installing firmware to data storage systems, ensuring that all identified critical devices are backed up, managing backup system file organization and providing an appropriate level of training to end users on roles and responsibilities relative to the management and backup systems. Services include planning and execution activities such as data risk profiling; systems inventory documentation; monitoring, alerting and remediating backup system issues; producing detailed recovery planning and actionable testing documentation. A number of services in this category can be prescheduled on a periodic basis as proactive preventative maintenance.

                     <p>
                        While all organizations tend to have massive amounts of simple file data, such as Word, Excel and PDF files, for example; there are other more sophisticated applications that may utilize database technologies (Microsoft SQL Server, as an example) or reside in the cloud and utilize various web services (Microsoft O365 and Azure, for example). While still considered data, these systems often require special backup and recovery considerations that influence how backup and recovery systems work. Additionally, there may be other tasks required to ensure proper ongoing efficient operation of these systems. We can also provide custom software programming services that include data integration between systems, software application development, databases and web services . While there are some services that we may do on a scheduled basis (such as database maintenance plan management), most of the services provided here are done on an as needed basis.

                        This category of services includes maintaining and supporting on premise and/or cloud-based servers and storage. We can conduct scheduled preventative maintenance services such as firmware updates, security and operating system update management; and also provide a number of other services such as maintaining Windows Active Directory object databases (user accounts, security groups, folder permissions), and other support tasks to keep your servers and storage working efficiently. A number of services in this category can be prescheduled on a periodic basis as proactive preventative maintenance.

                        This set of services focuses on keeping end users productive with their software and various end user devices. Much of the service provided in this area are provided to remedy unplanned inconveniences, on an as-needed or requested basis; and may include such things as end user training, software glitches, printers or scanners not functioning properly, workstations freezing up, failed hardware, etc. Other tasks, again more on an as-needed basis, may include setting up new devices or software. User training and documentation can lead to a long term trend in reducing a number of these issues. We can work with your team to provide ongoing training and documentation, especially where the organization as a whole can benefit from these things. Typical devices supported include desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, printers, scanners, and any other end user devices. The majority of services provided here tend to be scheduled as you contact us. We always advise that a single point of contact inside your organization works as a gatekeeper to coordinate support requests to ensure that these requests are consistent with your priorities and budget.

                     <p>
                        Network equipment is generally hidden away in a closet somewhere; however, its importance is extremely critical providing the backbone for connecting devices, both wired and wirelessly, and ensuring a healthy connection to your Internet Service Provider. This includes technology hardware items such as routers, firewalls, switches, wireless access points, physical cabling, etc. Our services include configuration, monitoring, management, firmware updates and documentation of these devices. We highly recommend keeping these devices up to date with software and firmware updates to ensure the best chances for appropriate performance and security. A number of services in this category can be prescheduled on a periodic basis as proactive preventative maintenance.

The majority of services provided here tend to be scheduled as you contact us to make changes to your system. It is often possible over time, with assistance from MaC in the form of training and documentation, to educate internal personnel to provide a number of these services. Services in this category that may be prescheduled on a periodic basis as proactive preventative maintenance include system backup and recovery testing and software and voice gateway version updates.
